[Microsoft released source code for MS-DOS and Word for
Windows](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/03/25/microsoft-makes-source-code-for-ms-dos-and-word-for-windows-available-to-public.aspx) this
week with the Computer History Museum.

Without reading the whole press release, you might think of it as Microsoft's
new move towards getting into the open source community. Actually the intent is
good, but it's not making them open source:

As I said the intent is good, but this effort might have been more meaningful
maybe 15 years ago. People could have learned many things from their work and
they could have used them in their fields. Who knows, maybe we would have had
better word processors by now.

Of course, this is about their marketing strategy, and I don't blame them for
this. I don't really think they are evil. They have some [good
efforts](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/openness/). Besides [Microsoft didn't
kill my pappy](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MicrosoftKilledMyPappy.aspx), not
yet.

You can grab source codes
of [MS-DOS](http://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/)
and [Word for
Windows](http://www.computerhistory.org/_static/atchm/microsoft-word-for-windows-1-1a-source-code/)
from the Computer History Museum's website.
