Iâ€™ve started learning the [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) platform
recently with a great book; [Hadoop: The Definitive
Guide](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449311520/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449311520&linkCode=as2&tag=thin0f5-20).
I had written some examples in terminal, but the projects were getting bigger
and bigger. Eventually, I decided to switch to an IDE and started using
Eclipse. Below I will explain two different ways to start your Hadoop Eclipse
project in standalone mode.

##Importing Libraries

Create a new project and add these libraries as a reference to your project.

* commons-configuration-1.6.jar
* commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar
* commons-lang-2.4.jar
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
* hadoop-core-1.0.0.jar
* jackson-core-asl-1.0.1.jar
* jackson-mapper-asl-1.0.1.jar

Add your source folder and you are ready to start your MapReduce application!

##Using Maven

First you need to create a pom.xml file. You can get it from my repository on
github.

After getting the pom.xml, you can create your Eclipse project with the
following command.

``mvn eclipse:eclipse``

Alternatively you can start a Java project in Eclipse, add pom.xml file to your
project, right click your pom.xml and select Run as > Maven Build. Then you
should write eclipse:eclipse to the Goals section and hit Run.

After the build is completed, right click on your project and Refresh your
project. You should see the added libraries in the Referenced Libraries
section.

Now, you can run your application.
