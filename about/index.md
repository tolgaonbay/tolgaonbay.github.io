title: About

Iâ€™m a never-satisfied-at-the-work type of software engineer started programming
in the middle of the 90s. I try to find great new technologies to poke into.
Sometimes I just read about them to get a general idea of what they are,
sometimes I use them. In T2C, I will write about what I learnt, what I
experienced, what I know and what I will find out in the IT field. In short,
mostly blog posts will be about things to code.

I love cycling, swimming, running, reading and lately writing, but mostly
coding. Oh, I have a wonderful wife and two little baby girls.
